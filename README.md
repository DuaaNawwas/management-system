### Task1

14/8/2022
I made an object constructor for employees with their information and rendered their names and salaries to the console.
I also added a header and a footer to the page.

### Task2

15/8/2022
I made a function that adds a table with the employees information to the html page and styles the table

### Task3

16/8/2022
I changed the table to individual cards for each employee, added a form where you can add new employees cards and save them in the local storage in an array.
I also added simple styles to the page.

17/8/2022
Fixed the local storage so you can refresh the page and not lose the cards you added
